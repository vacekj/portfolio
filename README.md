# Personal website of Josef Vacek

This is my personal website. My intention is for this to be the central place to learn about who I am, what I do, and how you can contact me.

In the interest of open-sourcing my life, I am constantly expanding this page with new data, insights, thoughts, work and other things from my life that I believe other people could find useful.
